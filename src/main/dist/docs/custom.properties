# Custom IFS Explorer Config
##

##
# Custom grid spacing.
#
# Setting `explorer.grid.max` equal to `explorer.window.width` (and also
# `explorer.window.height`) with `explorer.debug` set to 'true' will
# give just light gray grid lines at `explorer.grid.min` spacing in the
# editor window, with no thick gray lines and no red grid lines in the
# viewer window. Set `explorer.grid.snap` to a low value or '1' to give
# most flexibility in configuring transforms.
#
explorer.grid.min = 25
explorer.grid.max = 800
explorer.window.width = 800
explorer.window.height = 800
explorer.debug = true

# Performance.
#
# Thread count is set to the number of CPUs divided by two as a default.
# Increasing this will give more performance, but do not allocate more
# threads than CPUs. If running multiple copies of the application, this
# should be decreased, such as when rendering multiple animations in
# parallel.
explorer.threads = 6

##
# Display mode
#
# Override the `--colour` and `--palette` commmand-line arguments to set
# colour or grayscale directly.
#explorer.mode = colour
#explorer.mode = gray
explorer.mode = palette
#explorer.mode = stealing
#explorer.mode = ifscolour
##

##
# Rendering style
#
# The standard style renders the attractor set with transparency, 'ifs'
# mode uses opaque pixels. The 'top' mode renders the IFS top as described
# by Bransley. The 'measure' mode draws the IFS measure set on a black
# background with progressively brighter colours.
#
# These styles interact with the display modes in various ways, and not
# all modes make sense together.

# Palette and seed choices.
#
# Sample palettes are listed below, but any URL can be given as the
# source, as in the examplers below.

# Keep track of `explorer.palette.seed` values that produce a good
# range of colour values for the different `explorer.palette.file`
